## 🌍 About the Project

**Backpacker** is a social travel app that captures the real human connections made on the road.  
It’s designed for travelers who move between hostels, cities, and countries — people who build friendships through shared journeys rather than algorithms.

Instead of adding friends online, Backpacker connects people through real-world encounters. When two travelers meet and take a picture together, that moment is saved to an interactive map, showing where and with whom those memories were made. Each pin represents a person, a place, and a story.

The goal is to make travel memories **tangible** again — not just a gallery of photos, but a living map of human connections.

## ✈️ What We’re Building

We’re creating a platform where every encounter has a place and every traveler has a story.  
Backpacker bridges **social connection** and **location memory**, allowing users to keep track of the people they meet, the places they’ve been, and the shared experiences that shape their journeys.

This isn’t another social network — it’s a **map of relationships** built through real experiences.

## 🚀 Our Vision

Travel has always been about people — the strangers who become friends, and the moments that make a trip unforgettable.  
Over time, those memories fade, and so do the details of who and where. Backpacker brings those encounters back to life.

Our vision is to build the **world’s first social map for travelers**, a digital space that celebrates community, connection, and exploration.  

We believe that every traveler deserves a way to remember **who they met, where they met, and why it mattered.**
